although it has been suggested that eeg changes appear early_in_the_course of human batten disease these observations have been made only after the onset of clinical abnormalities and without immediate pathological correlation
in this brief report we have been able to document for the first time abnormal eegs in strain of dogs proposed as model for batten disease
the degree of abnormality in the canine eeg correlated with the degree of clinical involvement and with the presence of pathological inclusions resembling those seen in human batten disease
in younger dogs abnormal eegs were obtained even before clinical_manifestations of the disease
the large amplitude discharges reported with photic stimulation in children with the late_infantile form of batten disease were not elicited in the dog model
however this dog strain is model for the juvenile rather than the late_infantile form although similarities between dogs and both forms of human batten disease were seen
it is proposed that the eeg is both method for early_detection of this disease as well as tool ot measure the degree of involvement

sarcoidosis and whipple_disease association relation
on the basis of personal case in which two successive diagnoses of sarcoidosis and whipple_disease were made at an interval of four years the authors discuss the possible association or relationship between these two disorders both diffuse affecting the reticulo histiocytic system and diagnosed on histological basis
review in the literature of cases of whipple_disease with pleuro pulmonary lesions makes it possible on the one hand to associate with the latter numerous examples of extra_intestinal involvement the histological appearance of which of non_specific epithelioid granuloma does not indicate the diagnosis during the long pre intestinal phase and on the other hand to explain that during this period the presence of pleuro pulmonary lesions leads to an initial diagnosis of the probability of sarcoidosis
the practical consequences are as follows the appearance of intestinal signs during sarcoidosis should lead to intestinal or mesenteric node biopsy to seek the macrophages with highly pas positive cytoplasm characteristic of whipple_disease

ventricular premature beats and anatomically defined coronary_heart disease
ectopic activity persisted for at least of the hours in of the patients with coronary_heart disease of with other heart_disease and in of normal_subjects
the prevalence and grade of ventricular premature beats were increased in the patients with multivessel disease compared with values in the patients with one vessel disease less than
for the individual patient the prevalence and grade of ventricular ectopy may not always correlate with the severity of coronary_artery disease or degree of left_ventricular dysfunction
intraarterial sound was measured just distal to the aortic and pulmonary valves of subjects with no apparent valve disease
pulmonary_vascular disease after systemic pulmonary_arterial shunt operations
of these patients were studied to assess the presence of pulmonary_vascular disease and the time of its occurrence after surgery
they were selected either because lung tissue was available for histologic grading of pulmonary_vascular disease patients or because hemodynamic studies were performed after the shunt operation patients
after subclavan pulmonary_arterial shunt patients there was little evidence of advatients pulmonary_vascular disease in either histologic of patients or hemodynamic of patients studies
after an aortic pulmonary_arterial shunt waterston potts there was small likelikhood of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease with shunt duration of less than years of histologic of hemodynamic studies
with shunt duration of more than years the incidence of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease increased significantly of histologic of hemodynamic studies
mean pulmonary_arterial pressure of mm hg or greater strongly suggests the presence of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease
when systemic pulmonary_arterial shunt has provided effective palliation with decreased pulmonary pressure there is small likelihood that advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease will develop even with long shunt duration of to years
pulmonary_vascular disease in complete canal defect
the incidence and time of occurrence of pulmonary_vascular disease were studied in children with the complete form of canal defect
advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease begins to develop during the first year of life with intimal fibrosis grade cahnges noted between age months to year
these changes can be found in some patients in spite of hemodynamic findings usually considered to indicate lesser degrees of vascular_disease
after age years advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease is commonly found and may persist after surgical correction of the defects
similar rapid progression of pulmonary_vascular disease was noted in children who had large ventricular_septal defect without canal in whom systemic pressure was transmitted directly to the pulmonary_vascular bed
no difference was noted in the speed of progression of pulmonary_vascular disease between these children and those without trisomy
palliative or corrective surgery should be performed in these patients by age year to prevent development of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease

tissue_culture studies in hodgkin_disease morphologic cytogenetic cell_surface and enzymatic properties of cultures derived from splenic tumors
monolayer and suspension cell_cultures prepared from hodgkin_disease tumors in the spleen were examined microscopically and by cytogenetics tested for lymphocyte and monocyte cell_surface properties and assayed for enzymes by histochemical and techniques
hodgkin_disease monolayer cultures were composed of rapidly proliferating round and polygonal cells that were capable of propagation in vitro for an indefinite period_of_time
abnormal aneuploid chromosomes were found in short_term hodgkin_disease monolayers that had been passaged times and in established cell_lines carried in culture longer than yr and passaged more than times
cells fromhodgkin disease monolayers contained lysozyme muramidase fluoride resistant alpha naphthol acetate esterase acid and alkaline_phosphatase and chymotrypsin like activity
suspension cultures derived from hodgkin_disease monolayers were composed of cells with aneuploid karyotypes and similar enzymes
the hodgkin_disease suspension culture cells had surface receptors for complement and iggfc lacked surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and did not form erosettes react with an antithymocyte serum nor exhibit phagocytosis
the morphologic cytogenetic cell_surface and enzymatic findings_indicate that our hodgkin_disease monolayer and suspension cultures are composed of cells with many properties suggesting an origin from monocytes macrophages rather than lymphocytes or fibroblasts
the presence of aneuploid karyotypes is consistent with neoplastic origin and derivation from malignant cell of hodgkin_disease

treatment of haemorrhoids in patients with inflammatory_bowel disease
retrospective review of outcome was undertaken in forty two patients_with_ulcerative colitis and twenty patients_with_crohn disease who were treated for haemorrhoids and the inflammatory_bowel disease between and
in crohn_disease the complication rate was high complications after courses of treatment
one of the forty two patients_with_ulcerative colitis and six of the twenty with crohn_disease required rectal excision for complications apparently dating from the treatment of haemorrhoids

renal_tubular dysfunction in minamata disease detection of renal_tubular antigen and beta microglobin in the urine
minamata disease was found among the residents along minamata bay contaminated with the effluent from an industrial plant using mercury
evidence is described of renal_tubular dysfunction associated with this disease by the immunochemical demonstration or renal_tubular epithelial antigen and beta_microglobulin in the urine
nineteen patients with minamata disease and diseased and healthy_control subjects were examined
the contents of urinary renal_tubular epithelial antigen and beta_microglobulin and the ratios of these proteins to albumin in individuals with minamata disease were significantly_different from the levels in healthy_control subjects less than were identical to those found in patients with tubular and the values proteinuria

significant decrease in em was found in children with acute_lymphoblastic leukaemia and in children with solid tumours thus giving false_negative rate in malignant disease of as compared to false positives among children with non_malignant disorders of the later false_positive patients had autoimmune disease
results of the em test in the children with leukaemia were compared with those in patients with non_hodgkin lymphoma and with hodgkin_disease at different_stages but no striking change was seen between different diseases or after cessation of long_term chemotherapy
these results_indicate that patients with lymphoid malignancies still have lymphocytes which had been sensitized by common antigen of the malignant cell clone at the beginning of the disease
the em test furthermore could serve as an additional diagnostic aid in differentiating benign from malignant masses in the abdomen extremities or intracranial disease

histochemical comparison of the epithelial mucins in the ileum in crohn_disease and in normal_controls
comparison of routine and special histochemical methods that were applied to the epithelial mucins of small_intestine from patients_with_crohn disease and from normal_controls showed that the normal small_intestine ileum goblet cells secrete predominantly non sulphated sialomucin and that in to the colon the neuraminidase insensitivity of the sialic acids of the small_intestine was not due to either acylation at or an ester substituent at
presumably this implies that the protection against enzyme attack afforded to the mucosa by the mucin coat in the small_intestine utilises different mechanism from that in the colon and that although in many respects the small intestinal mucins in crohn_disease and in normal_controls are similar there is an increase in side chain acylated sialic acids in such mucins in crohn_disease

the various aspects of this disease and in particular the most recent diagnostic methods are examined and therapeutical possibilities from the medical and surgical standpoint are discussed
it is possible that these differences are related to the various phases in the course of the disease and that oligoclonal disturbation is marker of the auto_immune phase
none of the single manifestations is in itself specific or pathognomonic for this disease except for the disturbance of the metabolism of phytanic_acid
therefore clinical syndromes that involve similar manifestations without accumulations of phytanic_acid should not be included under the term heredopathia_atactica or refsum_disease
whatever the biochemical mechanism that links phytanic_acid accumulation with the clinical_manifestations of heredopathia_atactica it appears that the observations made on patients following successful dietary treatment leave little doubt that most if not all of the manifestations in this disease are caused in some way by the accumulation of phytanic_acid

when the unknown horse disease was being studied in the mid thirties in the ukraine the research workers headed by drobotko noticed that horses belonging to the army remained unaffected while in the same localities those belonging to the collective farms were stricken by this unknown disease
the collective farmers themselves had noted the link between the disease and the feeding of poor quality musty straw to horses
the numerous investigations remained fruitless for long time until jatel discovered straw which had been fed to horses before an outbreak of the disease
feeding of fodder infected with that fungus to experimental horses reproduced the pattern of the unknown disease which thereafter began to be known as
when human was studied all the clues in the epidemiological investigation pointed to barley straw as source of the disease
among collective farmers the disease had sudden onset and was mainly confined to men
no one contracted the disease who had not something to do with this musty straw
the disease bore familial character when farmers had used the straw as litter on their private holdings

iga immunoglobulins and hla antigen in wilms_tumor significance for the prognosis of the disease
thirty patients gave serologic evidence of epstein_barr virus infections antibodies to viral capsid antigen vca appeared very early only two seroconversions and cases of increased titer were detected antibodies to early antigen ea occured in patients but only had high_titers antibodies to nuclear_antigen ebna appeared late in the course of the disease
the disease occurs only in persons who lack antibody to this virus and serologic findings during the acute illness provide almost certain evidence for its etiologic association
the clinically relevant antibodies which develop during the disease other than heterophile antibody are those against the viral capsid antigen
the serologic hallmark of the disease is the presence of heterophile antibody
in one quarter of the families all examined first degree relatives of the proband were normolipidaemic and thus the disorder was classified as non genetic
multiple type combined familial hyperlipidaemia could be demonstrated in families and single type iib or iv familial disease was found in instances
exactly of the members of families with the multiple type lipid disorder were affected but the distribution of individual cholesterol and triglycerides values did not show definite bimodality
it is possible that the abnormality is heterogeneous and includes several disease entities which are by conventional lipid or lipoprotein analysis but can be separated by kinetic or enzyme studies

it was shown that aujeszky_disease virus administered intramuscularly caused viremy on th day after its application and disappeared from the blood circulation on th day introduced into the pig ankle joint the virus was eliminated from the articular fluid two hours after injection but it appeared again days later probably due to the propagation in the cells of the synovial_membrane and that first parenteral administration of the virus_induced the formation of neutralizing_antibodies in low titer units application of the virus for the second time brought about considerable increase of antibodies titer within units

serum high_density lipoproteins in peripheral_vascular disease
high_density lipoprotein_cholesterol has been measured by the autoanalyzer and apolipoproteins ii and by an immunochemical method in patients with peripheral_vascular disease and in age_and_sex matched_controls with an approximately similar prevalence of hyperlipidaemia
further analysis of the data showed low_levels to be related to the presence but not to the severity of the arterial disease and to be independent of concurrent hyperlipidaemia and smoking habits
it is therefore suggested that studies relating serum to arterial disease may be more informative if both the lipid and protein portions of these lipoproteins are measured

concentration of cytoplasmic rna in the endometrium in trophoblastic_disease
the method of was used to determine quantitatively the content of cytoplasmatic rna in cells of endometrial glands in females who suffered trophoblastic_disease
it was found that during the first year after the disease the rna content in the endometrium in patients subjected to chemotherapy was nearly twice as low as in females not treated with methotrexate
within the same period the rna content was mostly low in those who suffered malignant forms of the disease and were injected larger doses of the substance accordingly
if the duration of the disease was longer than year the rna content in the endometrium in both methotrexate treated and not females proved to be nearly the same in the former the content being reliably higher than the analogous value in the control_group females in phase of normal menstrual cycle secretion not suffering hydatid mole

association between graves_disease and hla has been previously documented as have been associations between gg heavy_chain allotype markers gm
positivity for fb in patients_with_graves disease compared to controls raising the possibility of allotypic restriction of thyroid_stimulating antibodies thought to be causally related to the disease
the influence of fb on the susceptibility to graves_disease was found to be independent of hla status suggesting that the immunological network operated by the linked genes is independent of that centered around igg allotypes
it is postulated that whereas the former genes determine the level of helper lymphocyte function in the production of thyroid_stimulating antibodies in graves_disease person who also happens to carry the gm marker fb would be assured of the production of igg antibodies with thyroid stimulatory activity

trypanosoma cruzi sensitized lymphocyte mediated cr release from human heart cells in chagas_disease
cytotoxicity of lymphocytes_from_patients with chagas_disease to parasitized and non parasitized human heart cells labelled with cr was demonstrated
the highest ratio of cr released from the normal non parasitized heart cells was observed when the lymphocytes were collected from patients with acute chagas_disease
the quantity of cr released from the normal heart cells that were destroyed by lymphocytes collected from patients_with_chronic chagas_disease was also significantly_higher than the quantity of cr released from normal heart cells incubated with lymphocytes from normal_donors
the specific release of cr from the heart cell_cultures destroyed by the immune lymphocytes_from_patients with acute chagas_disease and from patients_with_chronic disease was and respectively compared to the release of cr observed in control studies
the findings appear to indicate that lymphocytes_from_patients with chagas_disease are susceptible to activation by cross reactive heart cell antigen and suggest that an autoimmune mechanism can be established in some cases of acute chagas_disease and can be perpetuated in the chronic phase of this disease by the continuous antigenic stimulation
further these experimental data_indicate that the autoimmune destruction of heart cells in chagas_disease is produced by delayed type mediated by cruzi sensitized lymphocytes

the prevalence of elevated sace levels was not significantly_higher when the patient population was examined with respect to duration of disease radiological stage and the presence of abnormality in pulmonary function_tests
when patients were divided according to the frequency of clinical criteria of disease activity the presence of two or more criteria was associated with elevated sace levels in of patients
but sace levels were elevated in of patients judged to have dormant disease by clinical criteria
sace levels had an accuracy in prediction of disease activity and accruacy for prediction of inactivity
it was concluded that sace elevations have definite diagnostic_value in sarcoidosis and are helpful in establishing the presence of disease activity but are not sufficient to fully separate active from inactive disease groups

sinus_node recovery times and the premature atrial stimulus test were studied in patients seven with gross sinus_node disease with possible sinus_node disease and four with no clinical_evidence of sinus_node disease
the premature atrial stimulus test usually proved to be of no practical value once severe sinus_node disease was present and in the group of patients_with_suspected sino atrial disease only of graphs could be analysed due to gross scatter in the others
with lesser degrees of sino atrial disease premature atrial stimulation may provide confirmatory evidence but when sinus arrhythmia atrial escape beats or more marked dysfunction are present one is likely to encounter useless scatter graphs

cholesterol content of the high_density lipoproteins has become of interest in evaluating the risk of development of coronary_heart disease
the association of low_levels of hdl_cholesterol and defined coronary_artery disease
epidemiologic studies have found associations between low_levels of high_density lipoprotein_hdl cholesterol and increased_risk of coronary_artery disease using myocardial_infarction or angina pectoris as endpoints
however since most studies have not correlated hdl_cholesterol with the presence severity or location of anatomically proven coronary disease the present_study measured hdl_cholesterol levels in men_and_women undergoing coronary_arteriography
although women without coronary disease had much higher levels of hdl_cholesterol than men without coronary disease the differences between men_and_women with similar degrees of coronary disease were small
low_levels of hdl_cholesterol were associated with left_main coronary disease patients with both triple_vessel disease and left_main disease had lower levels of hdl_cholesterol than did patients with triple_vessel disease without left_main disease
these findings_suggest that low_levels of hdl_cholesterol are important risk_factors for the development of atherosclerosis and that they may be useful for identifying patients at high_risk of certain anatomic patterns of coronary_artery disease

elevated_serum and spleen angiotensin_converting enzyme and serum lysozyme in gaucher_disease
in adult chronic non neuronopathic type gaucher_disease significant less than elevations of angiotensin_converting enzyme in serum nmol_min
the increased angiotensin_converting enzyme ace in gaucher_disease may be related to the genetic defect resulting in increased ace synthesis in gaucher cells or perhaps generally while high lysozyme may reflect an increased body mass of cells
these enzyme elevations may be of use in suggesting the possible presence of gaucher_disease and perhaps in assessing the magnitude of pathologic involvement

hla haplotype associations with disease
higher order interactions that is to say of particular haplotypes with disease are much more complicated than individual antigen associations with which most disease studies have so far been concerned
the main emphasis is to point out that it is not easily possible to detect haplotype associations if an individual antigen association with the disease exists
these should provide clearer indication of the relevance of the hla including dr and possibly of other non hla loci to the possible mechanism of disease susceptibility

it was only in that in very important paper crohn ginsburg and oppenheimer defined the terminal ileitis afterwards called regional enteritis and finally more simply crohn_disease
twenty years_later in crohn_disease of the colon confused until that date with colonic tuberculosis and with ulcerative_colitis
since that time the number of reported_cases has tremendously increased through its is impossible to state whether the incidence of the disease has really increased or whether the diagnosis is done earlier and more precisely
even today the exacts limits of the disease are difficult to precise since the causal agent of the disease is unknown and that no biological test is completely secure
antibodies against the epstein_barr virus nuclear_antigen in children with malignant disease author_transl
pathology of the crohn_disease of colon author_transl
the examination of postoperative specimens and of biopsic specimens of the rectum concerning colic crohn_disease mcc confirm the known macroscopic and histologic characteristics of this disease
radiological aspects of colonic involvement in patients whose disease has been followed up during several years are described
extension of disease has not been uncommon in the series even without surgery
this progression was different according to the initial location of disease in the case of initial ileal lesion extension occurred towards the adjacent caecum and right colon in sequence in the case of initial colitis or ileocolitis lesion extension occurred at distance in other colonic segments
extra_intestinal manifestations of crohn_disease author_transl
the extra_intestinal manifestations of crohn_disease cd are not devoid of interest
amongst our cases of crohn_disease of the colon or of the ileon and colon articular manifestations were the most frequent arthralgias cases true arthritis cases cases aacro ileitis cas finger hippocratism cases
some complications were the local consequence of local disease hydronephrosis
others represented the distant repercussion of severe chronical intestinal disease
some were true extra_intestinal localisations of the disease perineal ulcerations and para stomal ulcerations
finally some complications though non_specific of crohn_disease evolued in parallel to it some articular ocular dermatologic complications
in some cases they were anterior by several months or years to the intestinal symptoms of crohn_disease which suggests the existence of common etiological factors especially genetical
psychiatric aspects of crohn_disease author_transl
we have examined patients_suffering from crohn_disease almost all of them during an active spell
the texts dealing with the psychological aspects of crohn_disease acknowledge the influence of stress as precipitating factor
in short no author allows us to conclude formally in favour of psychosomatic origin of crohn_disease which confirms our impression after examination of the patients we have talked with or seen regularly
haematologic disorders in crohn_disease author_transl
anemia is the most commonly haematologic disorder observed in crohn_disease
anyhow heamatologic disorders seem markedly correlated with the activity of the disease and should be useful in the follow up patients_with_crohn disease
medical mangement of crohn_disease author_transl
medical_management of crohn_disease is above all symptomatic
surgical_treatment of crohn_disease of the colon cases author_transl
from to december thirty eight patients out of sixty having crohn_disease of the colon alone or with ileal and or rectal involvement were operated upon
we had four post_operative deaths and one long time after the intervention but in relation with the initial crohn_disease
twenty three patients had recurrence of the disease seven of them were re operated for this first recurrence two of them for second recurrence and one of these two last patients had third recurrence
management of the rectum in crohn_disease of the colon is difficult
leptospirosis in children not infrequent disease author_transl
the polymorphe character of the disease is pointed out
leptospirosis should be disease well known by the pediatrician
clinical biological and histological studies of this disease are successively recorded
although not invariably present in such tumours their similarity with the inclusions seen in osteoclasts_in_paget disease is underlined
menetrier disease and edematous syndrome author_transl

wilson_disease clinical_and_pathological study on cases author_transl
in connection with cases of wilson_disease the authors recall the main features of this hereditary metabolic_disorder at late_onset usually the second decade treatable with chelating agent when diagnosed at an early_stage
wilson_disease is first of all liver_disease and the authors emphasize the fact that cirrhosis is usually present when neurologic symptoms revealing the disease in cases appear even if there is no clinical or biological evidence for liver_disease
this fact brings up the puzzling question of the pathogesis of the disease
wilson_disease is not simple ceruleoplasmin synthesis defect but lysosomal disease responsible for the lack of copper biliary excretion
evidence for shared idiotypy expressed by the igm igg and iga serum_proteins of patient with complex multiple paraprotein disorder
glomerular disease associated with myelofibrosis author_transl
the authors_report the case of year_old patient presenting with membranous proliferative glomerular disease megakaryocytes present in the glomerular capillaries evolving concomitantly with myelofibrosis
there are two possible explanations for this unusual association the glomerular disease and the myelofibrosis may both result from the same etiologic and pathogenic factor or the glomerular disease may be the consequence thrombocytosis existing of platelet activation either direct or after deposition of immune_complexes
the formation of immune_complexes after antigenic stimulation in myelofibrosis is theoretically compatible with immunitary anomalies found in the evolution of this disorder as described_in_the_literature
the listeriosis frequency is increasing the disease is recurrent with periodicity of four years but the number of the cases which are observed every year is larger than that which has been observed four years before
the disease seems to affect mainly the women in reality both sexes are sensitive but some conditions especially the pregnancy are favouring the disease burst
sequences complementary to mulvr cdna were found in dna from tissues of some patients with leukemia of hodgkin_disease of and one patient with multiple myeloma
dna from spleen and kidney of patient with nonneoplastic disease did not contain detectable mulvr related sequences
the absence of these nucleic_acid sequences in many tissues of patients with neoplasia and from the few tissues examined from people with nonneoplastic disease suggests that they are not endogenous elements but are acquired after fertilization

in subjects with hodgkin_disease bone_marrow biopsies were carried out did not lead to the discovery of any tumour permitted us to discover tumour
bone_marrow involvement at the start of the disease was found in of cases even in stages and ii
the bone_marrow which may be used to detect hematogenic spread of hodgkin_disease is an investigation which should be carried out as routine in the early_stages of the disease and whenever relapse is suspected
it was not possible to draw up correlations between the type of granulocyte maturation and or the presence of myelofibrosis and on the other hand the clinical_course of the disease but the small number of case studied both in our series and in the literature do not permit one to carry out proper statistical study

php is disorder characterized by renal and or skeletal refractoriness to the effect of parathyroid_hormone pth
php type is disorder which fails to show the increase of urinary amp and phosphaturia by the administration of pth but php type_ii is that which responds to the administration of pth with marked rise of urinary amp but no increase of phosphate excretion in rodriguez
thus in php type the lack of amp response to pth coupled with the ability of infused dbc amp to evoke normal renal response suggests that the metabolic_defect in this disorder may exist in hormone receptor adenyl cyclase complex
conclusively these results clearly suggest that the nature of the metabolic defects in php is not genetically_determined inrreversible disorder but rather functional one which can be reversibly restored by special conditioning

indirect test for serodiagnosis of legionnaires_disease evidence for serogroup diversity of legionnaires_disease bacterial antigens and for multiple specificity of human antibodies
evidence obtained by others who used direct staining to demonstrate serological differences among strains of legionnaires_disease bacterium prompted this study of parameters influencing the ability of the indirect test to detect human antibodies to legionnaires_disease bacterium
total of legionnaires_disease bacterium strains representing four serogroups were used as antigens to test selected human sera
instead heat killed suspensions of legionnaires_disease bacterium in buffered normal chicken yolk sac were used to show the serogroup diversity of the strains and the serogroup specificity of the antibody_response of some but not all patients with serological evidence of legionnaires_disease
these studies suggest that multiple antigens should be used in serological tests for legionnaires_disease

pathophysiology of cushing_disease
the term cushing_disease is applied to those cases of cushing_syndrome in which is secondary to inappropriate secretion of acth by the pituitary
patients_with_cushing disease in the presence of obvious pituitary tumors cannot be distinguished from those without pituitary tumors by studying only the pituitary function
all these and other well known facts would favor the concept that acth_secretion in cushing_disease is under hypothalamic control whether or not pituitary tumor is present
moreover there are observations that suggest that brain centers superior to the area of the hypothalamus are involved in the pathophysiology of cushing_disease
in some patients with severe psychiatric diseases neuroendocrine abnormalities are present that resemble closely those characteristic for cushing_disease
with the most refined methods pituitary microadenomas are demonstrable in approximately of patients_with_cushing disease and this number compares well with those of earlier autopsy findings to
it is established that complete cure of cushing_disease can be obtained in most patients with selective removal of microadenoma from the pituitary_gland

on the occurrence of serum antibodies to bacteroides fragilis and serogroups of coli in patients_with_crohn disease
eight strains of bacteroides fragilis five isolated from patients_with_crohn disease and three from healthy_individuals and according to biochemical tests belonging to four subspecies were subjected to serologic examination with tube agglutination and passive ha tests using hyperimmune rabbit antisera
crude antigens of each of the eight fragilis strains and eight known serotypes of nonenteropathic coli were used in passive ha tests to study the occurrence of circulating hemagglutinins in patients_with_crohn disease and in control patients and healthy_individuals with no obvious intestinal disease
it was found that patients_with_crohn disease had higher titres against fragilis than control patients and healthy_individuals the value was less than if titres greater_than_or_equal to were chosen as comparison equal for males and females

electron_spin resonance as useful technique in the management of hodgkin_disease
electron_spin resonance spectroscopy has proved useful and simple technique for the measurement of levels of caeruloplasmin and iron transferrin in whole blood from patients_with_hodgkin disease
those patients with clinically active disease show higher caeruloplasmin levels and lower iron transferrin levels than those with inactive disease
the results_indicate that these tests are good indicators of the state of the disease and that serial measurement of these parameters may help in early prediction of clinical reactivity and in monitoring response to treatment
caeruloplasmin and iron transferrin level were measured in blood of patients with non_hodgkin lymphoma in different_stages of disease activity and compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and nap level in the same samples
it was found that both caeruloplasmin level and sedimentation rate showed slight increase in mean level in patients with active disease as compared with those in remission particularly in the group of patients with poorly or diffuse disease
both caeruloplasmin and sedimentation rate showed occasional abnormal values in patients in remission but in most cases where both were elevated the patients subsequently entered more active phase of the disease

because of our prior demonstration of strong association betwen specific lymphocyte determinant and the occurrence of chronic and the demonstration by others of the frequent concurrence of an iga deposit disease anaphylactoid purpura nephritis with hla_bw we conducted an investigation of the association among minnesota caucasians of the hla markers bw dw and lymphocyte determinants identified by three alloantisera with iga nephropathy and the syndrome of recurrent macroscopic hematuria
dw was the same among controls and patients whereas the relative_risk of developing iga nephropathy was demonstrated to be increased to fold in the presence of the cell antigens identified by alloantisera and these sera appear to identify determinants on lymphocytes associated with the disease state and possibly not intimately related to the hla region
these findings emphasize the possible informativeness of defining cell alloantisera on disease panels

osteopetrosis albers schoenberg disease iii current nosographic aspects and relations to other condensing osteopathies
malignant paediatric variety and an adult variety of albers sch nberg disease are normally distinguished
on the basis of recent findings and personal observation it would appear advisable to accept two different courses of albers sch nberg disease in adults one resembling the malignant infant form and the other with slow practically asymptomatic apart obviously from the skeletal lesions course allowing for prolonged survival
other hereditary familial and constitutional condensing osteopathy pictures exist that present radiological stigmata similar to those seen in albers sch nberg disease

micrometastatic disease can be eradicated with effective chemotherapy in several diseases
prolongation of disease free_interval if not cure is now possible in diseases in which curative surgery alone or in combination with radiotherapy does not achieve these goals
the prolongation of the disease free_interval in osteogenic sarcoma has permitted consideration of entirely new surgical approaches for this tumor in which radical amputation has traditionally been employed
clinically recognizable metastatic_disease is rarely curable by any currently available treatment modality
the prolongation of disease free intervals and production of cures when surgical adjuvant_chemotherapy is employed may be partly explained by relatively more circulation and thus drug delivery to each tumor cell more favorable cellular kinetics and healthier and more immunocompetent host who is better able to withstand drug effects on normal tissues and to participate in tumor destruction

studies on the radioreceptor_assay of tsh the properties of tsh binding inhibitor immunoglobulins tbii in patients_with_graves disease author_transl
in the radioreceptor_assay system for tsh serum immunoglobulin igg from some patients_with_graves disease has been shown to inhibit the binding of labelled tsh to its receptor sites
in order to clarify the properties of these tsh binding inhibitor immunoglobulins tbii in patients_with_graves disease tbii were measured in sera from untreated and treated patients and their relation to clinical_and_laboratory findings was studied
tbii were detected in out of patients with untreated_graves disease
there were many patients_with_graves disease whose sera contained high tbii levels but no detectable bioassayable thyroid_stimulating activity lats and in these patients close correlation was observed between serum_levels of tbii and bioassayable lats protector activity
in patients_with_graves disease who had been treated by from to years before the incidence of tbii was very low at
these findings_suggest that tbii in patients_with_graves disease were in close association with human_thyroid stimulating activity and that tbii might be useful as an indicator for checking the effectiveness of the treatment
tsh binding inhibitor immunoglobulins tbii have been detected not only in patients_with_graves disease but also in those with hashimoto_thyroiditis by using the radioreceptor_assay of tsh

in contrast to wild_type vesicular_stomatitis virus vsv which produces fulminant illness with death in two to three days mixtures of homologous defective autointerfering di particles and wild_type vsv di wild_type vsv injected intracerebrally into mice resulted in slowly progressive disease of the central_nervous system_cns
the slowly progressive cns disease accompanying infection with di wild_type vsv was characterized by production of only of the amount of vsv recovered when wild_type vsv was injected alone
morphologically mice infected with di wild_type vsv displayed spectrum of pathologic changes not encountered with disease due to wild_type vsv alone
since these pathological_features are not found when cns disease results from either wild_type vsv or temperature_sensitive ts mutants of vsv it is suggested that cns infection with ts vsv is not mediated principally by production of di particles

extramammary_paget disease critical reexamination
fifty five patients with extramammary_paget disease were the source of material for this study
extramammary_paget disease could be divided histologically according to where paget cells were found namely wholly within the epidermis and the epithelial structures of adnexa and the dermis within the epidermis the epithelial structures of adnexa and contiguous epithelia of other organs such as the genitourinary and tracts
our conclusions are that extramammary_paget disease is more than one disease and in most instances begins in the epidermis as an adenocardinoma and extends from there into contiguous epithelium of hair follicles and eccrine sweat ducts
rarely extramammary_paget disease results from direct extension into the skin of an adenocarcinoma in contiguous organ such as the genitourinary or tract

crystalline state disorder and hyperfine component line widths in ferric hemoglobin chains
due to large anisotropy in the tensors the line width variation can be accounted for on the basis of heme orientation disorder
this disorder is characterized by an angle determined here by two independent methods
in these computations gaussian disorder on sphere is assumed
the disorder angle is found to be constant on the sphere and about degrees for both alpha_and_beta chains
treatment of crystals with heavy water buffer increases the disorder
since ligand nitrogen hyperfine couplings are available from hemoglobin electron nuclear double resonance single crystal electron paramagnetic resonance spectra can be simulated by superimposing hyperfine bands where the line width of the component bands is variable and the disorder model above is employed

cholestatic liver did not show significant alterations in the specific contents of any of these three components of the microsomal mixed function oxidase system but the two livers with severe parenchymal disease showed substantial reductions in all three
it is therefore concluded that vertical transmission if it occurs at all is of little significance in the epidemiology of the disease
the number of serologically virologically and maedi visna positive sheep the time of onset of disease and the severity of lesions were related to the duration of exposure to the parent flock

diagnostic and therapeutic limitations in gestational_trophoblastic disease
thyrotropin displacement activity of serum immunoglobulins from patients_with_graves disease
in active graves_disease tda was above normal in of the cases and in the remaining patients it was above the th percentile suggesting that thyroid_stimulating ig tsig may have been present in all cases but not always demonstrable by this method
it was also negative in some patients with euthyroid ophthalmic graves_disease
in patients_with_graves disease controlled with antithyroid_drugs positive tda accurately predicted the recurrence of hyperthyroidism in eight of nine cases from whom the drugs were withdrawn
thus tsig appears to be prerequisite of the hyperthyroidism of graves_disease

the prevalence of tsi in graves_disease was investigated with radioligand receptor assay using human_thyroid membranes and highly purified labeled porcine tsh or bovine tsh in patients before treatment and in patients after successful_treatment with antithyroid_drugs
our data cannot prove the hypothesis that only humoral antibodies are responsible for the thyroid stimulation in graves_disease but of course they cannot exclude it furthermore they suggest the existence of antibodies which bind to the human_thyroid cell membrane without necessarily stimulating thyroid cellular activity
the agent of this disease belongs to the retravirus group
altered responsiveness to thyrotropin in thyroid slices of graves_disease preoperatively treated with excess iodide

notes on the mechanism of postvaccination immunity in marek_disease
the investigated th and th in vitro passages of non pathogenic variant of the kekava_strain marek_disease virus have led in chickens to resistance to marek_disease by introduction of the above mentioned virus days before application of pathogenic variant of the kekava_strain marek_disease virus
simultaneous administration of both variants of the kekava strains marek_disease virus did not protect chickens from the disease
presence in those variants of the kekava_strain marek_disease virus of genetic markers manifesting themselves on passaging the virus in chicken fibroblast cultures created the possibility to investigate interrelations between them in the organism of chickens utilizing in isolation of the virus the method of infecting cultures with chicken fibroblasts
the results of isolation of the virus from the blood cells of vaccinated chickens have shown that in their organism there is interference between those virus variants since the frequency of isolation of the pathogenic virus variant was times lower than that of the apathogenic kekava_strain marek_disease virus and both virus variants persisted in various cells
after simultaneous administration of both virus variants to chickens equal amounts of the pathogenic and of the apathogenic kekava_strain marek_disease virus were isolated from their blood cells

effect of potassium magnesium aspartate on hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism of coronary disease patient during beta_receptor stimulation
series of patients with proven coronary_artery disease were studied under the influence of an infusion of beta_receptor stimulating drug heptaminole and of kalium magnesium aspartate kma in high series mg of heptaminole in min and low doses series ii mg of heptaminole in min of beta_receptor stimulation
the results confirm the finding that high dose beta_receptor stimulation in patients with severe coronary_artery disease results in failure of the contractile mechanism of the heart with the beta_receptor angina
for this action to become relevant in coronary_artery disease situation would have to be postulated in which an additional limiting factor of oxydative metabolism would be an inadequate supply of krebs cycle intermediates
as with virus infections those disease organisms possessing cyclical host vector relationship will possess variable infectivity potential which is not necessarily related to the abundance of any of the organisms in the cycle
clearly feeding behavior and host preferences of the vector are important in determining the rate and extent of disease transmission and such parameters can be quantified in epidemiological_studies
however complete understanding of the factors concerned in cyclical disease transmission also depends on knowledge of the physiology of the organisms involved and particularly of the interdependence of their physiologies

perivascular cells in cns tissue from six multiple_sclerosis ms patients and patient with motor_neuron disease were examined by light_and_electron microscopy
cns perivascular macrophages in both ma and motor_neuron disease were found to closely resemble free macrophages elsewhere in the body except that they often contained unusually large primary lysosomes
no plasma cells were observed in the cns in motor_neuron disease
the results also suggest that in some chronic ms cases there is large permanent population of cns plasma cells that persists like the elevated cerebrospinal_fluid igg level in this disease for the life of the patient that these cells rather than inflammatory cells in fresh lesions are the major source of this raised igg and that the existence of such population of cells may indicate the continuing expression of antigens in chronic ms lesions in the absence of fresh lesion formation

characteristics of inapparent aleutian_disease virus_infection in mink
inapparent of nonprogressive aleutian_disease virus_adv infection is subclinical but persistent virus_infection of mink
mink with the inapparent type of adv infection when subjected to stress did not develop the progessive form of the disease
however when challenged with large dose of the virus these mink did develop progressive_aleutian disease indicating that they were not highly resistant to the virus
the anti adv antibody activity in mink with inapparent type of adv infection was in the igg fraction of the serum the same as in mink with progressive_aleutian disease
these data_indicate that the resistance of the mink with inapparent infection as compared to mink with progressive_aleutian disease was not due to difference in the class of immunoglobulin response to the virus
however mink with progressive_aleutian disease showed greatly increased immunoglobulin response

possible biochemical basis of memory disorder in alzheimer_disease
the most common presenting symptom of alzheimer_disease is loss of short_term memory and histologically the hippocampus is affected
choline which is involved in the synthesis of acetylcholine is depleted in the hippocampus in the disorder
anticholinergic drugs administered to normal_subjects can simulate some aspects of the memory defect seen in alzheimer_disease
it is postulated that damage to cholinergic neuronal pathway running to or from the hippocampus underlies the memory disorder
this suggestion implies that it may be possible to improve memory in patients with alzheimer_disease by pharmacological means

impaired very low_density lipoprotein and triglyceride removal in broad_beta disease comparison with endogenous
the removal rate of apoprotein apo in very low_density lipoprotein vldl was decreased in individuals with broad_beta disease when compared with endogenous
following the injection of vldl isolated from individuals with endogenous both vldl apo fractional catabolic rate hr and vldl apo turnover rate mg_kg hr were lower in broad_beta disease than in endogenous fractional catabolic rate less than turnover rate less than despite equivalent plasma_concentrations of vldl apo furthermore conversion of vldl apo to ldl was impaired in broad_beta disease relative to endogenous
these differences suggest an abnormality in the interaction of lipoprotein_lipase with the lipoproteins of unusual composition in broad_beta disease
this is further supported by the normalization of lipoprotein composition in broad_beta disease by estrogen therapy with simultaneous change in the kinetics of lipoprotein_lipase related triglyceride removal towards those seen in endogenous
tangier_disease one explanation of lipid_storage
normal high_density lipoproteins are absent from plasma in tangier_disease and the disorder is characterized by accumulation of cholesteryl esters in several tissues particularly those of the system

this paper describes some other subtle signs related to the phenomenon of denervation which is well known to physiologists and clinicians involved in peripheral_nerve disease yet its related signs have not been applied to low back pain
the results of surgical_treatment in patients with carcinoma_of_the_lung were analyzed by stage of disease and by histologic cell type
only per cent of this group died of the disease and per cent of other causes
the yield of positive preoperative scans in patients with stages and ii disease is low and confounded by relatively high percentage of false_positive results
conversely per cent of patients with stage_iii disease had evidence of bony metastasis at the time of operation
again there was correlation with initial clinical staging with to times more conversions in patients with stage_ii or iii disease than in those with stage disease
we believe that the finding of multiple petechia like hemorrhages glomerulations on the second distention of the bladder is the hallmark of interstitial cystitis and that reduced bladder capacity and hunner ulcer represent different classic stage of this disease
the presence of eosinophils and mast cells is variable and even in the classic disease the muscularis often appears to be normal
bladder instillations with per cent solution of oxychlorosene sodium clorpactin wcs have provided remarkable relief for many patients with this disease particulary those with the classic form

plasma high_density lipoproteins and ischemic_heart disease studies in large kindred with familial
the expression of ischemic_heart disease was studied in large kindred with familial
the upper quartile of total and low_density lipoprotein_cholesterol contained all but two cases of ischemic disease whereas the lower quartile of high_density lipoprotein_cholesterol contained one half of the cases
the ratio of high to low_density lipoprotein_cholesterol range to was less than or equal to in each patient with ischemic disease
the association of low_level of high_density lipoprotein_cholesterol with ischemic disease persisted after adjustment for differences in other lipids_and_lipoproteins
low_level of high_density lipoprotein_cholesterol as well as high level of low_density lipoprotein_cholesterol may influence the development of ischemic_heart disease in this disorder

when absolute granulocyte counts fell below cu mm cause for fever was generally identified regardless of disease status
we propose that the majority of febrile episodes in patients at the time of induction of treatment or in relapse with neutrophil counts of more than cu mm are caused by the disease process rather than secondary to diagnosable infection
the use of methylphenidate and imipramine in gilles_de la_tourette disease in children
the authors treated two children with gilles_de la_tourette disease and one child with probable combination of gilles_de la_tourette disease and minimal brain dysfunction with methylphenidate which resulted in exacerbation of symptoms

few cases of pachyonychia congenita are reported in the dental and medical literature because of the rarity of the disease
examination of year_old boy revealed the presence of the disease which was also present in the mother and newborn sibling
it is widely recognized that oral health has its major obstacles in the form of dental_caries and periodontal diseases and that in many populations each of these disease areas attacks nearly of the population during the normal life span
furthermore there are clear signs of sharp increases in the dental_caries problem in populations which previously benefited by near absence or low prevalence of the disease
for highly developed countries dental_caries and periodontal_disease are responsible for an ever increasing economic burden which could easily become intolerable for even the richest of economies

growth of cultured cells from patients_with_hodgkin disease and transplantation into nude_mice
long_term monolayer cell_cultures have been prepared from tumor nodules in spleens removed from patients_with_hodgkin disease and from spleens that did not have tumors from hodgkin_disease patients normal adult spleens and human fetal spleens and thymuses
after to serial passages in culture cells from nine of the hodgkin_disease monolayers underwent morphologic change in vitro with transition from spindle and reticular pattern of replication to polygonal and round cells that propagated in mosaic arrays
four of such hodgkin_disease monolayer cell_lines were injected subcutaneously into nude athymic mice
transplanted tumors were not observed in athymic mice injected with cultures prepared from normal human adult spleen and fetal spleen and thymus nor were tumors seen in similar animals that received fresh noncultured hodgkin_disease tumor tissue
on microscopic_examination xenografts derived from hodgkin_disease cultures were pleomorphic malignant_neoplasms composed of large cells resembling reticulum cell sarcoma
the ability of these hodgkin_disease cell_lines to produce invasive tumors with human karyotypes in nude_mice is evidence of the neoplastic nature of the monolayer cells and their relationship to the malignant cell of the human disorder
in contrast to antipsychosis drugs which inhibit the dopamine activated adenylate_cyclase atp pyrophosphate lyase cyclizing ec of caudate_nucleus dopaminergic drugs for treatment of parkinson_disease stimulate this cyclase

the incidence and characteristics of acute_myeloid leukaemia arising in hodgkin_disease
in consecutive_patients with hodgkin_disease treated from through with intensive irradiation and or combination_chemotherapy cases of acute_myeloid leukaemia were observed
an analysis of reported_cases of acute_myeloid leukaemia arising in hodgkin_disease shows that these cases differ considerably from spontaneous cases of acute_myeloid leukaemia by appearing in much younger age_group by very poor response to anti leukaemic chemotherapy and by relatively low male female ratio
the intensification of radiotherapy and cytostatic therapy of hodgkin_disease during the last decade is considered the explanation of the increased incidence of acute_myeloid leukaemia in these patients

in the first cases the initial disorder was renal problem renal homograft
by contrast in the fourth case the primary disease was already malignant in nature breast neoplasm and treatment was mixed radiotherapy_and_chemotherapy
for example conclusions as to therapy result from the exact analysis of and the distinction between the causes of disease and the pathogenic factors
the intensity necessary for the psychic component to cause manifest clinical_symptoms depends on the distinctness of the basic somatic cardiac disorder
the studies_were_carried out in the first episode of the disease before treatment and in some patients they were repeated during relapse after remission or improvement
the question of fetal hemoglobin synthesis reactivation is current topic both from the aspect of the genetic regulation of synthesis and from the aspect of the disorder of erythropoiesis in malignant diseases

changes in inflammatory gingival disease of the anterior dental area of the mandible caused by therapy are evaluated with the help of surface morphometric methods
in technically advanced countries the high tooth mortality due to caries is decreasing as result of widespread dental care though the incidence of the disease is little affected
in both cases the development of preventive_measures against periodontal_disease is essential if teeth saved from loss by caries are not to be lost in later decades from the ravages of periodontal breakdown
epidemiological_studies can only indicate cause disease relationship while laboratory experiments can only be applied to the human situation as working hypothesis
the greatest need is for health_education designed to influence the lifestyle of people in way which will reduce the prevalence of dental disease
the ability of the lausanne strain to persist and its effective transmission compared with the glenfield strain may be due in part to the more florid symptoms of the disease

the age of patients with coronary_heart disease and the severity of the lesions preclude the wide application of marathon running to the general coronary_heart disease population
less than subjects with coronary_heart disease have been estimated as potentially being able to achieve by high level training maximum vo sufficient to complete marathon race in hours
over publicized marathon running by few subjects has aroused unrealistic expectations for the majority of coronary_heart disease subjects and probably similarly for considerable number of coronary prone subjects many of whom have silent coronary disease
coronary_heart disease in marathon runners
two athletes had significant arterial disease of two major coronary_arteries third had stenosis of the anterior descending and the fourth of the right coronary_artery
we conclude that the marathon runners studied were not immune to coronary_heart disease nor to coronary atherosclerosis and that high_levels of physical fitness did not guarantee the absence of significant cardiovascular_disease
our conclusions do not reflect on the possible value of exercise in the prevention_of_coronary heart_disease
rather we refute exaggerated claims that marathon running provides complete immunity from coronary_heart disease

sequential changes of surfactant in hyaline_membrane disease of the newborn
although reduced levels of lung surfactant are known to predispose to hyaline_membrane disease the role of biochemical changes in surfactant composition has not been defined
we found that surfactant isolated from pharyngeal and tracheal aspirates of newborns with hyaline_membrane disease had distinctly different fatty_acid composition from surfactant of control infants
surfactant from newborns with hyaline_membrane disease had lower percentage of palmitic acid and higher percentages of the carbon and carbon fatty_acids irrespective of gestational age
evaluation of serial aspirates for days revealed that in hyaline_membrane disease the surfactant fatty_acids followed predictable pattern of change gradually becoming similar to those of the control_group
evaluation of surfactant from tracheal and pharyngeal aspirates effectively monitors the biochemical maturation of the surfactant system in hyaline_membrane disease

relationships among immunoglobulin markers in graves_disease
thyroid_stimulating immunoglobulin tsi activity was measured by radioreceptor_assay in sera from patients_with_graves disease hashimoto_thyroiditis and thyroid cancer
in untreated_graves disease cases tsi index was significantly_lower se than the average of normal control_group cases
after treatment the tsi index in graves_disease decreased during months then increased and reached normal levels in yr
there was no significant relationship between tsi index and thyroid antibodies microsomal antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies in untreated_graves disease or hashimoto_thyroiditis
it is concluded that in the sera of patients_with_graves disease and hashimoto_thyroiditis there are immunoglobulin gs that can displace tsh binding to thyroid membranes these immunoglobulins
gs are different from the classic antithyroid antibodies and treatment of graves_disease may enhance tsi production during the first months after therapy

the effect of cy treatment on the immunological parameters and the clinical_course of the eye disease was also studied
the mean tbab index for all patients with eye disease was significantly less than that for the normal and for patients_with_graves hyperthyroidism who lacked eye disease
the mean tbab index for patients with ophthalmopathy and past or present hyperthyroidism was significantly less than for those patients with eye disease but no associated hyperthyroidism euthyroid graves_disease
tbab levels did not correlate with the severity of duration of the eye disease and did not change during treatment with cy
significant titres of serum antibodies against human eye muscle extract or subcellular fractions or macrophage inhibitory factor mif production in response to human orbital tissue extract were not detected in patients with eye disease
tbab are unlikely to play_role in the pathogenesis of graves ophthalmopathy and the hyperthyroidism and eye disease should be considered separate autoimmune disorders
the apparently anomalous finding of higher mean tbab index in patients with eye disease and hyperthyroidism than in those with hyperthyroidiam alone may reflect more severe defect of suppressor cell function in the former group

study of hyperthyroidism based on cases of basedow_disease author_transl
an study of nine patients_with_graves disease before and after treatment demonstrates changes in myocardial contractility predominantly in the posterior wall and to lesser extent in the septum
these results affirm the functional character of this disease dismissing the existence of an autonome cardiomyopathy of thyroid etiology

delayed hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy_for_graves disease is prevented by parathyroid
late hypocalcemia appears associated with thyroidectomy_for_graves disease more frequently than with thyroidectomy for other conditions
of total thyroidectomies done by single surgeon were done for carcinoma for benign disease primarily nontoxic nodules with history of radiation_therapy to the head_and_neck rt and for graves_disease
mean calcium concentrations measured two months or more after surgery were sem mg for patients with cancer mg_dl for patients_with_graves disease and mg_dl for patients with other benign diseases
no patient without graves_disease developed late hypocalcemia
the incidence of hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy_for_graves disease was significantly_greater than that seen in other conditions
since no parathyroids were removed in the patients_with_graves disease and since branches of the inferior thyroid artery were invariably ligated distal to the parathyroids we hypothesized that the late hypocalcemia might be associated with peculiarity in scar formation in the presence of this autoimmune disease
accordingly parathyroid was performed synchronously as prophylactic measure in nine subsequent patients_undergoing total thyroidectomy_for_graves disease no instance of late hypocalcemia has occurred in this group
although the precise etiology of late hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy_for_graves disease remains undetermined this experience indicates that synchronous parathyroid is beneficial in preventing this complication

we suggest that significant neurotrophic corneal disease can occur in diabetic_patients
diaphoresis and meniere disease
the effect of diaphoresis on patients with meniere disease labyrinthine hydrops previously has not been reported
with the use of two distinct activities to produce diaphoresis we were able to document substantial transient improvements in pure tone threshold speech reception threshold and speech discrimination concurrent with decrease in tinnitus and fullness in two patients with unilateral meniere disease that had been diagnosed previously by the glycerin test
glycerin an osmotic diuretic produces similar temporary beneficial effects primarily in patients in the fluctuant hearing stage of meniere disease

the association of lipoid nephrosis with certain types of locus hl suggest that these immunity alterations might signify predisposing factor genetically transmitted and suggest the systematic study of these abnormalities in parents and siblings of patients with this disease
malnutrition as an expression of social disease conceptual models
the evolution the causality concepts have had allow the interpretation of the initial interest to explain the origin of disease with the purpose of offering treatment in scientific basis
once the relation between malnutrition and the energetic and protein deficiencies have been recognized another phase of knowledge was initiated having primarily preventive goal under this new guidance the attention of research workers was directed to the identification of the disease as manifestation of the inadequate social integration of man in the economical political and cultural aspects as in the psychosocial
this disease is congenital malformation of the central_nervous system attended constantly by partial or total agenesia of the corpus callosum
the embryologic disturbances distinctive of this disease are pointed out and correlation is made

to explain the associations of water hardness and air temperature with area differences in ischaemic_heart disease mortality samples of tap water were obtained from homes in county boroughs in england_and_wales and the concentration of calcium and other elements was estimated
the well known negative association between water hardness and ischaemic_heart disease was shown to be due to calcium and none of other elements examined appeared to contribute significantly to the association
there was little association between temperature and ischaemic_heart disease
this is shown to discriminate more effectively than does existing health information between hypotheses concerning geographical variations in mortality and it provides adequate explanations for urban area differentials in infant mortality the uptake of vaccination and the incidence of infectious disease
the results_indicate the role of genetical factors in the etiology of both types of affective_disorder and show that unipolar depression and manic depressive psychosis are distinct entities
psychiatric_disorder was found in per cent of the children compared with per cent of children from control_group of families
families with disturbed children differed from the remaining families in the following ways presence of frank marital discord the diagnosis of personality_disorder in the parents the inability of the father to tolerate angry situations and the presence of siblings of under years_of_age
it is suggested that the psychiatric_disorder of these children is reactive to the presence of emotional turmoil in the families

the disease is not primary panarteritis as observed in takayusu disease or allergic vasculitis
males are predominantly affected and present invariably with clinical_signs and symptoms of peripheral_vascular obliterative disease of the lower extremities
their detection gives more accurate assessment of the extent of disease
aphthoid ulceration has been demonstrated prior to the onset of bowel symptoms and several years before the advent of severe colonic disease
the appearance of aphthoid ulcers in established quiescent disease has been observed to herald relapse
the radiographic demonstration of the evolution of ulceration which is illustrated closely reflects what is seen on macroscopic examination of excised specimens and explains the characteristic patchiness and discontinuity of disease
the two film barium meal in the exclusion of coeliac_disease
prospective experience over five years is described in assessing the two film barium meal as test for the exclusion of untreated celiac_disease in children in order to try to make jejunal biopsy unnecessary
meals were examined in children between months and years_of_age with variety of gastro intestinal symptoms and signs that might be attributed to celiac_disease
in children with untreated coeliace disease there were only three with negative two film barium meals
in children with malabsorption from causes other than coeliac_disease there were four with negative two film barium meals
it is concluded that the two film barium meal is reasonably reliable test for the exclusion of untreated_coeliac disease in children
lymphography may be valuable in cases where data from clinical observations and routine radiological studies is inconclusive in cases of vague abdominal disease
when malignancies were treated with radiation_therapy pre irradiation clearly depicted the site and extent of the disease and post irradiation study showed marked shrinkage of the tumour mass and or markedly improved raggedness of the wall of the nasopharynx
collagen of dupuytren_disease
in contrast to collagen from the aponeurosis of normal adult subjects the nodules contractures and apparently unaffected aponeurosis from patients with dupuytren_disease contained substantial amounts of type_iii collagen
the increased amounts in the apparently unaffected aponeurosis indicate the disease is not strictly focal but more systemic than is usually considered
the results showed that coal tar dyes particularly brilliant lake red were closely related to the cause of the disease
the relevance of ultraviolet light to the disease was found to be much less than the ratio expected
high_incidence of positive responses to fragrances was also found but it is considered to play secondary role in the etiology of the disease
the work of breathing was measured in normal_subjects and in critically ill patients with acute complications of obstructive_pulmonary disease treated with assisted ventilation
the measurement of the work of breathing against an inspiratory resistance of cm was useful in the identification and quantification of ventilatory reserve in patients with obstructive_pulmonary disease

sinus_node disease was present in and cardiac ischemia and or hypertension in another the remaining case had apparently coincidental wolff parkinson white wpw syndrome
the response to exercise during increasing workloads supine bicycling was studied in men of whom had ischemic_heart disease and did not clinically classed into groups
the ischemic_heart disease ihd subjects differed from the nonischemic by an increased pep lvet ratio at rest and by tendency of the diastolic blood_pressure to increase upon exercise
quantitative nuclear in valvular_heart disease
the method was applied to patients with valvular_heart disease proven by heart catherization
the following results were obtained the method proved to be highly sensitive in stating whether there was hemodynamically significant valvular disease or not
but differential_diagnosis concerning the different forms of valvular disease was not possible
the prolongation of the circulation times correlated with the hemodynamic severity of the disease
validation of the questionnaires by means of coronary angiography and follow up in selected cases indicated ny superiority over who in predicting the presence of coronary_heart disease chd

men with chronic_liver disease frequently develop clinical_signs of hypogonadism and overt feminisation
the unstirred layer in seven healthy_volunteers mum mean sem was significantly thicker than in patients with active coeliac_disease mum but not significantly_different in seven_patients who had responded to treatment by gluten withdrawal mum
analysis of the results using computer simulation indicates that the reduction in apparent km in active coeliac_disease can be caused by the interaction of the decreased maximal absorption rate for glucose jmax with the attenuated unstirred layer
it is remarkable that the disease process produces an apparent km which is much closer to the real km than that found in health
increased tissue concentrations of in the duodenal_mucosa of patients with coeliac_disease
tissue concentrations of ht have been measured in the duodenal_mucosa of adults and children with coeliac_disease and were found to be significantly_higher than those from control_group
this finding may be associated with hyperactivity or hyperplasia of ec cells in the duodenum of patients with coeliac_disease and could also be directly related to described abnormalities of ht metabolism in this disease
serum_bile acids in the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease
the value of serum_bile acids sba in the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease has been investigated
all icteric patients had raised sba but in anicteric patients there was no significant_difference in the detection of chronic_liver disease by fasting sba postprandial sba ast or gamma gtp
association of abnormal fibrin polymerisation with severe liver_disease
the frequent occurrence of abnormal fibrin polymerisation in patients with liver_disease has recently been reported
to investigate this further fibrin polymerisation was studied in patients with cirrhosis or chronic_active liver_disease
it is concluded that defective fibrin polymerisation occurring in patients with liver_disease indicates the presence of severely impaired hepatocellular function
there is no appreciable relationship between the disease and the life history of the patient
the patient is more liable to the disease when she is on the strain while hearing tune
our consideration of the mechanism of the disease has led to the presumptive conclusion that hyperacusis conditioned reflexes and the impact of life history may be involved and the fragility of the memory function of the temporal lobe underlie the genesis of the disease

the pathology of sandhoff disease
we have presented the morbid anatomy of case of sandhoff disease and have attempted to outline morphologic differences which distinguish this entity from other gm gangliosidoses
the anatomic differences among tay_sachs disease and its variants are more quantitative than qualitative and are overshadowed by the similarities
nevertheless if many bizarre mcb are encountered the enzyme defect may be expected to differ from that of classical tay_sachs disease and when seen in endothelial cells they favour sandhoff disease
more importantly if prominent visceral storage is found and especially if it extends beyond the system to involve such selective sites as the kidneys and pancreas sandhoff disease should immediately come to mind
for the pathologist it is this latter point which more readily sets apart sandhoff disease from related gm gangliosidoses
reliability was for example high with clinically certain heart_disease and low with cerebrovascular_disease

near maximal exercise responses in health and disease in middle_aged chinese men
cardiovascular aerobic and ventilatory responses to multistage treadmill test of near maximal exercise were determined in middle_aged chinese men to provide standards in health and to identify differences in relation to hypertension coronary_heart disease chronic_pulmonary disease and stroke
except in patients with hypertension exercise duration was shortened and symptom limited oxygen uptake was reduced in all disease groups
unexpectedly stroke patients exhibited lower heart rate responses to exercise than did patients with coronary_heart disease
the side effect however disappeared days after the initiation of the treatment and was considered to be due to underlying disease of the patient

no evidence for processes was obtained although inhibiting antibody levels to ndv were elevated in birds with cns disease
studies of an avirulent strain of ndv that replicated in the cns but produced no disease provided evidence that the histologic lesions and the neurologic disease were related to virus multiplication in the brain parenchyma
mechanism of the pathogenesis of ndv encephalitis is proposed and the disease is discussed relative to other paramyxovirus induced encephalitic syndromes

monoamine oxidase activity in rheumatic_heart disease associated with symptomatic hypertension
study of the hormone content and enzyme_activity in patients with hypertensive_disease at rest and in various types of stimulation revealed predominance of pressor humoral systems over depressor ones
with the development of the disease the reaction of these humoral systems to stimulation diminishes
activization of the humoral depressor systems in the initial_stage of the disease is conducive to the preservation of the water electrolyte hemostasis in the organism and maintains the labile level of arterial pressure despite the increased activity of the natrium retaining hormones
aldosterone concentration proved to be elevated in half the patients mostly in those with stage_ii of the disease
the blood antidiuretic activity was studied in patients with hypertensive_disease in period between crises and during hypertensive crisis
it is concluded that the antidiuretic hormone plays pathogenetic role in hypertensive_disease which is marked by the development of crises
blood_plasma renin activity was studied by the radioimmune method in clino and orthostatism in males with hypertensive_disease and in healthy males before and after day medication with furosemide in daily dose of mg under in patient conditions
diversity was revealed between patients with different_stages of hypertensive_disease
stage ib of the disease was characterized by increased renin activity in orthostatism and marked reaction to stimulation with furosemide
hypotensive effect after intake of furosemide was observed in patients with iib stage of hypertensive_disease
changes are observed in the renal kallikrein kinin system in hypertensive_disease which are displayed by compensatory increase in its activity in patients with labile hypertension and decrease in the activity of this system in patients with stable stage of the disease
the kallikrein kinin system is concerned with the noted shifts in renal_function linked with the transport of sodium and water in patients with the labile stage of the disease to which the correlative connection between kallikrein excretion and natriuresis and urine excretion attests
it is suggested that the renal kallikrein kinin system in patients with the initial_stage of hypertensive_disease contributes to the adaptation of renal_function to the altered conditions of hemodynamics and the increased activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system
the indices of central hemodynamics were studied during hemiton therapy in patients with stage iia and iib hypertensive_disease by means of noninvasive method tetrapolar chest rheography
changes in the coagulation properties of blood under the effect of physical exertion on bicycle ergometer were studied in patients with hypertensive_disease
the degree of these changes depended on the age of the disease and the load of the exertion
in patients with different_stages of hypertensive_disease besides studying the calculated values of systemic hemodynamics minute volume total peripheral_vascular resistance was used to study values characterizing the state of intracardiac hemodynamics end diastolic vd end systolic vs and stroke ve volumes the ejection_fraction ef and the left_ventricular myocardium mass mm
it is shown that with gradual progression of hypertensive_disease the number of patients in the second subgroup increases and the number of those in the second subgroup decreases respectively
comparatively new hemodynamic aspects of hypertensive_disease connected with the contribution of the heart itself to the pathogenesis of the disease are discussed
it is suggested that among patients with hypertensive_disease there are individuals with predominant and early involvement of the heart in the pathological process with rapid development of left_ventricular hypertrophy

comparison of the indices of myocardial contractility and of the results of bicycle ergometer test in chronic_ischemic heart_disease
on comparing the results of study of the indices under conditions of submaximum or threshold bicycle ergometry load with the findings of at rest in patients_with_chronic ischemic_heart disease the authors conclude that is very promising method for ascertaining the cardiac muscular reserve particularly in those patients with ischemic_heart disease in whom the low coronary reserve does not allow the performance of tests under conditions of physical exertion
on the basis of clinico anatomical analysis of the causes of death in patients following valve prosthetics for rheumatic valvular disease it was established that cardiac failure was the most frequent cause
the extent of the defect is largely determined by the evolution of the disease
diagnosis and the prognostic_significance of blocks occurring in ischemic_heart disease
in fatal outcomes of the disease these indices fluctuated within the range of the individual levels of the initial values without showing any obvious tendency to decrease in the first weeks of the disease
on the strength of their own findings and the information in the current literature the authors name among other precoditions for training diminution of capacity for muscular work psychologic instability and the persisting threat of the progression of ischemic_heart disease

stress or trigger situation notions illustrated by comparison of stress ulcer to triggering of attacks of gastroduodenal ulcer disease
the author attempts to show the fundamental difference existing between the two often confused concepts of stress and trigger situation using the example of stress ulcer and trigger situation of the outbursts of the ulcer disease
in contrast to the picture of the door forcefully kicked in as in the stress ulcer for the trigger situation of the outbursts of the ulcer disease we have used picture of beck key perfectly fitting the lock
except during organic brain disease disturbances of time experience are observed especially during endogenous psychoses

the problem whether l ffler endocarditis and endomyocardial fibrosis belong to the same disease spectrum or are separate entities is still under debate
until recently it was believed that endomyocardial fibrosis was disorder restricted to tropical areas
three danish patients are presented two showing continuous disease spectrum one patient showing the fully developed endomyocardial fibrosis which is from endomyocardial fibrosis described from the tropical areas
the findings described in these three patients lend support to the unitarian hypothesis that l ffler endocarditis and endomyocardial fibrosis belong to the same disease spectrum and that the eosinophilic granulocyte may be the underlying cause

gaze failure drifting eye movements and centripetal nystagmus in cerebellar disease
three abnormalities of eye movement in man are described which are indicative of cerebellar system disorder namely centripetally beating nystagmus failure to maintain lateral gaze either in darkness or with eye closure and slow drifting movements of the eyes in the absence of fixation
these abnormalities of eye movement together with other signs of cerebellar disease such as rebound alternating and gaze paretic nystagmus are explained by the hypothesis that the cerebellum helps to maintain lateral gaze and that brain_stem mechanisms which monitor gaze position generate compensatory biases in the absence of normal cerebellar function

bile_acid studies in uncomplicated crohn_disease
the pool size and composition of bile_acids were studied in unoperated patients with uncomplicated crohn_disease patients_with_ulcerative colitis and normal_subjects
many patients_with_crohn disease had in their bile significantly_increased amount of ursodeoxycholic acid
the bile_acid pool size was significantly decreased and the ratio of glycine to taurine conjugates was significantly_increased in the crohn_disease patients
the reduction in bile_acid pool size was related to the activity of the disease
the disorders of bile_acid metabolism suggest that the intestinal involvement in crohn_disease is much more extensive than can be demonstrated by careful radiological examinations
glycocholate test in crohn_disease its value in assessment and treatment
the glycocholic acid test gca has been assessed in patients who have had resection of the ileum and colon for crohn_disease and in patients with unoperated stable crohn_disease

the case presented emphasizes that toxocara canis can involve the anterior segment of the eye as an isolated disease process
most cases of ocular toxocara canis are not associated with the other features of the visceral larva migrans syndrome but certainly represents spectrum of the same parasitic disease
the vlm syndrome is usually benign self_limited disease but occasionally severe ocular pulmonary or cns involvement may result
the diagnosis should be considered in any child with unilateral ocular inflammatory disease especially if there is history of geophagia or exposure to dogs
