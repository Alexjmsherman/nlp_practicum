detection of canine batten disease with the eeg
although it has been suggested that eeg changes appear early in the course of human batten disease these observations have been made only after the onset of clinical abnormalities and without immediate pathological correlation
in this brief report we have been able to document for the first time abnormal eegs in strain of dogs proposed as model for batten disease
the degree of abnormality in the canine eeg correlated with the degree of clinical involvement and with the presence of pathological inclusions resembling those seen in human batten disease
in younger dogs abnormal eegs were obtained even before clinical manifestations of the disease
the large amplitude discharges reported with photic stimulation in children with the late infantile form of batten disease were not elicited in the dog model
however this dog strain is model for the juvenile rather than the late infantile form although similarities between dogs and both forms of human batten disease were seen
it is proposed that the eeg is both method for early detection of this disease as well as tool ot measure the degree of involvement

sarcoidosis and whipple disease association relation
on the basis of personal case in which two successive diagnoses of sarcoidosis and whipple disease were made at an interval of four years the authors discuss the possible association or relationship between these two disorders both diffuse affecting the reticulo histiocytic system and diagnosed on histological basis
review in the literature of cases of whipple disease with pleuro pulmonary lesions makes it possible on the one hand to associate with the latter numerous examples of extra intestinal involvement the histological appearance of which of non specific epithelioid granuloma does not indicate the diagnosis during the long pre intestinal phase and on the other hand to explain that during this period the presence of pleuro pulmonary lesions leads to an initial diagnosis of the probability of sarcoidosis
the practical consequences are as follows the appearance of intestinal signs during sarcoidosis should lead to intestinal or mesenteric node biopsy to seek the macrophages with highly pas positive cytoplasm characteristic of whipple disease

intraarterial sound was measured just distal to the aortic and pulmonary valves of subjects with no apparent valve disease
pulmonary vascular disease after systemic pulmonary arterial shunt operations
of these patients were studied to assess the presence of pulmonary vascular disease and the time of its occurrence after surgery
they were selected either because lung tissue was available for histologic grading of pulmonary vascular disease patients or because hemodynamic studies were performed after the shunt operation patients
after subclavan pulmonary arterial shunt patients there was little evidence of advatients pulmonary vascular disease in either histologic of patients or hemodynamic of patients studies
after an aortic pulmonary arterial shunt waterston potts there was small likelikhood of advanced pulmonary vascular disease with shunt duration of less than years of histologic of hemodynamic studies
with shunt duration of more than years the incidence of advanced pulmonary vascular disease increased significantly of histologic of hemodynamic studies
mean pulmonary arterial pressure of mm hg or greater strongly suggests the presence of advanced pulmonary vascular disease
when systemic pulmonary arterial shunt has provided effective palliation with decreased pulmonary pressure there is small likelihood that advanced pulmonary vascular disease will develop even with long shunt duration of to years
pulmonary vascular disease in complete canal defect
the incidence and time of occurrence of pulmonary vascular disease were studied in children with the complete form of canal defect
advanced pulmonary vascular disease begins to develop during the first year of life with intimal fibrosis grade cahnges noted between age months to year
these changes can be found in some patients in spite of hemodynamic findings usually considered to indicate lesser degrees of vascular disease
after age years advanced pulmonary vascular disease is commonly found and may persist after surgical correction of the defects
similar rapid progression of pulmonary vascular disease was noted in children who had large ventricular septal defect without canal in whom systemic pressure was transmitted directly to the pulmonary vascular bed
no difference was noted in the speed of progression of pulmonary vascular disease between these children and those without trisomy
palliative or corrective surgery should be performed in these patients by age year to prevent development of advanced pulmonary vascular disease

tissue culture studies in hodgkin disease morphologic cytogenetic cell surface and enzymatic properties of cultures derived from splenic tumors
monolayer and suspension cell cultures prepared from hodgkin disease tumors in the spleen were examined microscopically and by cytogenetics tested for lymphocyte and monocyte cell surface properties and assayed for enzymes by histochemical and techniques
hodgkin disease monolayer cultures were composed of rapidly proliferating round and polygonal cells that were capable of propagation in vitro for an indefinite period of time
abnormal aneuploid chromosomes were found in short term hodgkin disease monolayers that had been passaged times and in established cell lines carried in culture longer than yr and passaged more than times
cells fromhodgkin disease monolayers contained lysozyme muramidase fluoride resistant alpha naphthol acetate esterase acid and alkaline phosphatase and chymotrypsin like activity
suspension cultures derived from hodgkin disease monolayers were composed of cells with aneuploid karyotypes and similar enzymes
the hodgkin disease suspension culture cells had surface receptors for complement and iggfc lacked surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and did not form erosettes react with an antithymocyte serum nor exhibit phagocytosis
the morphologic cytogenetic cell surface and enzymatic findings indicate that our hodgkin disease monolayer and suspension cultures are composed of cells with many properties suggesting an origin from monocytes macrophages rather than lymphocytes or fibroblasts
the presence of aneuploid karyotypes is consistent with neoplastic origin and derivation from malignant cell of hodgkin disease

retrospective review of outcome was undertaken in forty two patients with ulcerative colitis and twenty patients with crohn disease who were treated for haemorrhoids and the inflammatory bowel disease between and
in crohn disease the complication rate was high complications after courses of treatment
one of the forty two patients with ulcerative colitis and six of the twenty with crohn disease required rectal excision for complications apparently dating from the treatment of haemorrhoids
these results suggest that treatment of symptomatic haemorrhoids is usually safe in patients with ulcerative colitis but is contraindicated in those with crohn disease

to determine whether community health education can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease field experiment was conducted in three northern california towns
people from each community were interviewed and examined before the campaigns began and one and two years afterwards to assess knowledge and behaviour related to cardiovascular disease diet and smoking and also to measure physiological indicators of risk blood pressure relative weight and plasma cholesterol
in the control community the risk of cardiovascular disease increased over the two years but in the treatment communities there was substantial and sustained decrease in risk
these results strongly suggest that mass media education campaigns directed at entire communities may be very effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease

renal tubular dysfunction in minamata disease detection of renal tubular antigen and beta microglobin in the urine
minamata disease was found among the residents along minamata bay contaminated with the effluent from an industrial plant using mercury
evidence is described of renal tubular dysfunction associated with this disease by the immunochemical demonstration or renal tubular epithelial antigen and beta microglobulin in the urine
nineteen patients with minamata disease and diseased and healthy control subjects were examined
the contents of urinary renal tubular epithelial antigen and beta microglobulin and the ratios of these proteins to albumin in individuals with minamata disease were significantly different from the levels in healthy control subjects less than were identical to those found in patients with tubular and the values proteinuria
these results indicate that minamata disease is associated with renal tubular dysfunction and also suggest that these procedures would be useful for screening the nephrotoxicity in the environmental exposure of heavy metals

significant decrease in em was found in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in children with solid tumours thus giving false negative rate in malignant disease of as compared to false positives among children with non malignant disorders of the later false positive patients had autoimmune disease
results of the em test in the children with leukaemia were compared with those in patients with non hodgkin lymphoma and with hodgkin disease at different stages but no striking change was seen between different diseases or after cessation of long term chemotherapy
these results indicate that patients with lymphoid malignancies still have lymphocytes which had been sensitized by common antigen of the malignant cell clone at the beginning of the disease

histochemical comparison of the epithelial mucins in the ileum in crohn disease and in normal controls
comparison of routine and special histochemical methods that were applied to the epithelial mucins of small intestine from patients with crohn disease and from normal controls showed that the normal small intestine ileum goblet cells secrete predominantly non sulphated sialomucin and that in to the colon the neuraminidase insensitivity of the sialic acids of the small intestine was not due to either acylation at or an ester substituent at
presumably this implies that the protection against enzyme attack afforded to the mucosa by the mucin coat in the small intestine utilises different mechanism from that in the colon and that although in many respects the small intestinal mucins in crohn disease and in normal controls are similar there is an increase in side chain acylated sialic acids in such mucins in crohn disease

none of the single manifestations is in itself specific or pathognomonic for this disease except for the disturbance of the metabolism of phytanic acid
therefore clinical syndromes that involve similar manifestations without accumulations of phytanic acid should not be included under the term heredopathia atactica or refsum disease

thirty patients gave serologic evidence of epstein barr virus infections antibodies to viral capsid antigen vca appeared very early only two seroconversions and cases of increased titer were detected antibodies to early antigen ea occured in patients but only had high titers antibodies to nuclear antigen ebna appeared late in the course of the disease
the disease occurs only in persons who lack antibody to this virus and serologic findings during the acute illness provide almost certain evidence for its etiologic association
the clinically relevant antibodies which develop during the disease other than heterophile antibody are those against the viral capsid antigen
the serologic hallmark of the disease is the presence of heterophile antibody

high density lipoproteins in the prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease part epidemiological and family studies
it has recently been proposed that the concentration of the high density lipoprotein hdl fraction in plasma bears negative relationship to the incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease
despite methodological inadequacies in some studies the epidemiological evidence consistently reflects an inverse relationship between the level of hdl in the plasma and the risk of ischaemic heart disease
investigations on families suffering from genetic characterized by reduced levels of low density lipoprotein ldl relative to hdl suggest that the ldl hdl ratio is itself an important determinant of atherosclerotic heart disease

serum high density lipoproteins in peripheral vascular disease
high density lipoprotein cholesterol has been measured by the autoanalyzer and apolipoproteins ii and by an immunochemical method in patients with peripheral vascular disease and in age and sex matched controls with an approximately similar prevalence of hyperlipidaemia
further analysis of the data showed low levels to be related to the presence but not to the severity of the arterial disease and to be independent of concurrent hyperlipidaemia and smoking habits
it is therefore suggested that studies relating serum to arterial disease may be more informative if both the lipid and protein portions of these lipoproteins are measured

concentration of cytoplasmic rna in the endometrium in trophoblastic disease
the method of was used to determine quantitatively the content of cytoplasmatic rna in cells of endometrial glands in females who suffered trophoblastic disease
it was found that during the first year after the disease the rna content in the endometrium in patients subjected to chemotherapy was nearly twice as low as in females not treated with methotrexate
within the same period the rna content was mostly low in those who suffered malignant forms of the disease and were injected larger doses of the substance accordingly
if the duration of the disease was longer than year the rna content in the endometrium in both methotrexate treated and not females proved to be nearly the same in the former the content being reliably higher than the analogous value in the control group females in phase of normal menstrual cycle secretion not suffering hydatid mole

positivity for fb in patients with graves disease compared to controls raising the possibility of allotypic restriction of thyroid stimulating antibodies thought to be causally related to the disease
the influence of fb on the susceptibility to graves disease was found to be independent of hla status suggesting that the immunological network operated by the linked genes is independent of that centered around igg allotypes
it is postulated that whereas the former genes determine the level of helper lymphocyte function in the production of thyroid stimulating antibodies in graves disease person who also happens to carry the gm marker fb would be assured of the production of igg antibodies with thyroid stimulatory activity

the prevalence of elevated sace levels was not significantly higher when the patient population was examined with respect to duration of disease radiological stage and the presence of abnormality in pulmonary function tests
when patients were divided according to the frequency of clinical criteria of disease activity the presence of two or more criteria was associated with elevated sace levels in of patients
but sace levels were elevated in of patients judged to have dormant disease by clinical criteria
sace levels had an accuracy in prediction of disease activity and accruacy for prediction of inactivity
it was concluded that sace elevations have definite diagnostic value in sarcoidosis and are helpful in establishing the presence of disease activity but are not sufficient to fully separate active from inactive disease groups

cholesterol content of the high density lipoproteins has become of interest in evaluating the risk of development of coronary heart disease
the association of low levels of hdl cholesterol and defined coronary artery disease
epidemiologic studies have found associations between low levels of high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol and increased risk of coronary artery disease using myocardial infarction or angina pectoris as endpoints
however since most studies have not correlated hdl cholesterol with the presence severity or location of anatomically proven coronary disease the present study measured hdl cholesterol levels in men and women undergoing coronary arteriography
although women without coronary disease had much higher levels of hdl cholesterol than men without coronary disease the differences between men and women with similar degrees of coronary disease were small
although women without coronary disease had much higher levels of hdl cholesterol than men without coronary disease the differences between men and women with similar degrees of coronary disease were small

altered angiotensin conversion in pulmonary disease
converting enzyme activity in plasma from fifteen normal subjects eleven patients with sarcoidosis twelve patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and three patients with shock lung was assayed by this technique
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and shock lung had decreased plasma converting enzyme activity but extent of conversion did not correlate with the severity of the lung disease
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and shock lung had decreased plasma converting enzyme activity but extent of conversion did not correlate with the severity of the lung disease
twice as much exogenous angiotensin was needed to inhibit conversion completely in plasma from patients with sarcoidosis one tenth as much in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
these results indicate that plasma has high capacity for angiotensin conversion even in patients with pulmonary parenchymal disease
results suggest that plasma converting enzyme activity may be reflection of pulmonary conversion and can be altered by pulmonary disease

higher order interactions that is to say of particular haplotypes with disease are much more complicated than individual antigen associations with which most disease studies have so far been concerned
the main emphasis is to point out that it is not easily possible to detect haplotype associations if an individual antigen association with the disease exists
these should provide clearer indication of the relevance of the hla including dr and possibly of other non hla loci to the possible mechanism of disease susceptibility

hodgkin disease may sporadically occur in more than one member of family
family in which two siblings were documented to have the nodular sclerosing form of the disease was studied for immunological competency distribution of hl antigens and epstein barr virus ebv antibody titers
hl antigens previously reported to appear in hodgkin disease with increased frequency were not found
therefore none of the genetically associated laboratory tests related to cancer particularly hodgkin disease were found in this family
the evidence from this family thus supports the probable importance of environmental factors in the etiology of hodgkin disease particularly in the nodular sclerosis group

crohn disease of the colon history
during the th th and at the beginning of the th century various observations of inflammatory lesions of the colon and small intestine were published which were different of tuberculosis to which was at that time attributed every chronical small intestinal inflammatory disease
it was only in that in very important paper crohn ginsburg and oppenheimer defined the terminal ileitis afterwards called regional enteritis and finally more simply crohn disease
twenty years later in crohn disease of the colon confused until that date with colonic tuberculosis and with ulcerative colitis
since that time the number of reported cases has tremendously increased through its is impossible to state whether the incidence of the disease has really increased or whether the diagnosis is done earlier and more precisely
even today the exacts limits of the disease are difficult to precise since the causal agent of the disease is unknown and that no biological test is completely secure

some complications were the local consequence of local disease hydronephrosis
others represented the distant repercussion of severe chronical intestinal disease
some were true extra intestinal localisations of the disease perineal ulcerations and para stomal ulcerations
finally some complications though non specific of crohn disease evolued in parallel to it some articular ocular dermatologic complications
in some cases they were anterior by several months or years to the intestinal symptoms of crohn disease which suggests the existence of common etiological factors especially genetical

php is disorder characterized by renal and or skeletal refractoriness to the effect of parathyroid hormone pth
php type is disorder which fails to show the increase of urinary amp and phosphaturia by the administration of pth but php type ii is that which responds to the administration of pth with marked rise of urinary amp but no increase of phosphate excretion in rodriguez
thus in php type the lack of amp response to pth coupled with the ability of infused dbc amp to evoke normal renal response suggests that the metabolic defect in this disorder may exist in hormone receptor adenyl cyclase complex
conclusively these results clearly suggest that the nature of the metabolic defects in php is not genetically determined inrreversible disorder but rather functional one which can be reversibly restored by special conditioning

reduced incidence of marek disease gross lymphomas in cell depleted chickens
chickens of line highly susceptible to marek disease md were depleted of cells by neonatal thymectomy total body gamma irradiation and multiple injections with antithymocyte serum
the results of this and other published studies indicated that cells may have dual role in md they may serve as target for lymphoma formation by mdv and also may participate in immune surveillance against the disease in resistant chickens
these findings taken with previous reports of immune defects in patients with disorders of branched chain aminoacid catabolism suggest new biochemical basis for primary disease

pathophysiology of cushing disease
the term cushing disease is applied to those cases of cushing syndrome in which is secondary to inappropriate secretion of acth by the pituitary
patients with cushing disease in the presence of obvious pituitary tumors cannot be distinguished from those without pituitary tumors by studying only the pituitary function
all these and other well known facts would favor the concept that acth secretion in cushing disease is under hypothalamic control whether or not pituitary tumor is present
moreover there are observations that suggest that brain centers superior to the area of the hypothalamus are involved in the pathophysiology of cushing disease
in some patients with severe psychiatric diseases neuroendocrine abnormalities are present that resemble closely those characteristic for cushing disease
with the most refined methods pituitary microadenomas are demonstrable in approximately of patients with cushing disease and this number compares well with those of earlier autopsy findings to
it is established that complete cure of cushing disease can be obtained in most patients with selective removal of microadenoma from the pituitary gland

normal individuals with neutralizing antibody to hsv or hsv responded to virus antigen in culture as well as individuals with recurrent disease
data from individuals with recurrent disease was compared to that of normal individuals to determine whether the former demonstrated specific alteration in this response
individuals with recurrent disease were found to have higher neutralizing antibody titers than normals
the neutralizing antibody titers in normal individuals correlated well with the lymphocyte proliferation assay results whereas similar evaluation in individuals with recurrent disease gave negative correlation
the ratio of hsv response hsv response also demonstrated suppressed response in recurrent infections to the homologous virus during active disease which disappeared when the individual was convalescent
these studies indicate that individuals with recurrent hsv infections have virus antigen specific alterations of their cell mediated immune response which can be associated with their disease

because of our prior demonstration of strong association betwen specific lymphocyte determinant and the occurrence of chronic and the demonstration by others of the frequent concurrence of an iga deposit disease anaphylactoid purpura nephritis with hla bw we conducted an investigation of the association among minnesota caucasians of the hla markers bw dw and lymphocyte determinants identified by three alloantisera with iga nephropathy and the syndrome of recurrent macroscopic hematuria
dw was the same among controls and patients whereas the relative risk of developing iga nephropathy was demonstrated to be increased to fold in the presence of the cell antigens identified by alloantisera and these sera appear to identify determinants on lymphocytes associated with the disease state and possibly not intimately related to the hla region
these findings emphasize the possible informativeness of defining cell alloantisera on disease panels

studies on the radioreceptor assay of tsh the properties of tsh binding inhibitor immunoglobulins tbii in patients with graves disease author transl
in the radioreceptor assay system for tsh serum immunoglobulin igg from some patients with graves disease has been shown to inhibit the binding of labelled tsh to its receptor sites
in order to clarify the properties of these tsh binding inhibitor immunoglobulins tbii in patients with graves disease tbii were measured in sera from untreated and treated patients and their relation to clinical and laboratory findings was studied
tbii were detected in out of patients with untreated graves disease
there were many patients with graves disease whose sera contained high tbii levels but no detectable bioassayable thyroid stimulating activity lats and in these patients close correlation was observed between serum levels of tbii and bioassayable lats protector activity
in patients with graves disease who had been treated by from to years before the incidence of tbii was very low at
these findings suggest that tbii in patients with graves disease were in close association with human thyroid stimulating activity and that tbii might be useful as an indicator for checking the effectiveness of the treatment

the significance of calcific valvular heart disease in tc pyrophosphate myocardial infarction scanning radiographic scintigraphic and pathological correlation
in this study of patients with either calcific aortic or mitral valvular heart disease had positive ppi cardiac scintiscans and the location of the ppi uptake was limited to the calcific valve in all of the patients who underwent valve replacement surgery
six patients with valvular disease without radiologic evidence of calcium had negative ppi heart images
we conclude that while ppi heart scanning is sensitive indicator of acute myocardial infarction false positive scans can occur in the presence of calcific valvular disease due to localization of ppi in the calcified portion of the valve

in contrast to wild type vesicular stomatitis virus vsv which produces fulminant illness with death in two to three days mixtures of homologous defective autointerfering di particles and wild type vsv di wild type vsv injected intracerebrally into mice resulted in slowly progressive disease of the central nervous system cns
the slowly progressive cns disease accompanying infection with di wild type vsv was characterized by production of only of the amount of vsv recovered when wild type vsv was injected alone
morphologically mice infected with di wild type vsv displayed spectrum of pathologic changes not encountered with disease due to wild type vsv alone
since these pathological features are not found when cns disease results from either wild type vsv or temperature sensitive ts mutants of vsv it is suggested that cns infection with ts vsv is not mediated principally by production of di particles

crystalline state disorder and hyperfine component line widths in ferric hemoglobin chains
due to large anisotropy in the tensors the line width variation can be accounted for on the basis of heme orientation disorder
this disorder is characterized by an angle determined here by two independent methods
in these computations gaussian disorder on sphere is assumed
the disorder angle is found to be constant on the sphere and about degrees for both alpha and beta chains
treatment of crystals with heavy water buffer increases the disorder
since ligand nitrogen hyperfine couplings are available from hemoglobin electron nuclear double resonance single crystal electron paramagnetic resonance spectra can be simulated by superimposing hyperfine bands where the line width of the component bands is variable and the disorder model above is employed

simultaneous administration of both variants of the kekava strains marek disease virus did not protect chickens from the disease
simultaneous administration of both variants of the kekava strains marek disease virus did not protect chickens from the disease
presence in those variants of the kekava strain marek disease virus of genetic markers manifesting themselves on passaging the virus in chicken fibroblast cultures created the possibility to investigate interrelations between them in the organism of chickens utilizing in isolation of the virus the method of infecting cultures with chicken fibroblasts
the results of isolation of the virus from the blood cells of vaccinated chickens have shown that in their organism there is interference between those virus variants since the frequency of isolation of the pathogenic virus variant was times lower than that of the apathogenic kekava strain marek disease virus and both virus variants persisted in various cells
after simultaneous administration of both virus variants to chickens equal amounts of the pathogenic and of the apathogenic kekava strain marek disease virus were isolated from their blood cells

effect of potassium magnesium aspartate on hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism of coronary disease patient during beta receptor stimulation
series of patients with proven coronary artery disease were studied under the influence of an infusion of beta receptor stimulating drug heptaminole and of kalium magnesium aspartate kma in high series mg of heptaminole in min and low doses series ii mg of heptaminole in min of beta receptor stimulation
the results confirm the finding that high dose beta receptor stimulation in patients with severe coronary artery disease results in failure of the contractile mechanism of the heart with the beta receptor angina
for this action to become relevant in coronary artery disease situation would have to be postulated in which an additional limiting factor of oxydative metabolism would be an inadequate supply of krebs cycle intermediates
as with virus infections those disease organisms possessing cyclical host vector relationship will possess variable infectivity potential which is not necessarily related to the abundance of any of the organisms in the cycle
clearly feeding behavior and host preferences of the vector are important in determining the rate and extent of disease transmission and such parameters can be quantified in epidemiological studies
however complete understanding of the factors concerned in cyclical disease transmission also depends on knowledge of the physiology of the organisms involved and particularly of the interdependence of their physiologies

perivascular cells in cns tissue from six multiple sclerosis ms patients and patient with motor neuron disease were examined by light and electron microscopy
cns perivascular macrophages in both ma and motor neuron disease were found to closely resemble free macrophages elsewhere in the body except that they often contained unusually large primary lysosomes
no plasma cells were observed in the cns in motor neuron disease
the results also suggest that in some chronic ms cases there is large permanent population of cns plasma cells that persists like the elevated cerebrospinal fluid igg level in this disease for the life of the patient that these cells rather than inflammatory cells in fresh lesions are the major source of this raised igg and that the existence of such population of cells may indicate the continuing expression of antigens in chronic ms lesions in the absence of fresh lesion formation

long term controlled studies ranging from months to years and using reliable objective measures revela however that patients with rheumatoid arthritis improve in functional status and graduate to less severe classes of disease activity phenomenon not observed with either indomethacin or aspirin administered to matched patients over the same periods of time
since it has previously been established that the course of rheumatoid arthritis is reflected in the acute phase protein levels and the extent to which tryptophan is bound to plasma protein it is suggested that drugs such as penicillamin and alclofenac which profoundly affect these parameters provide not only symptomatic relief but also possible beneficial effects on the disease process itself

characteristics of inapparent aleutian disease virus infection in mink
inapparent of nonprogressive aleutian disease virus adv infection is subclinical but persistent virus infection of mink
mink with the inapparent type of adv infection when subjected to stress did not develop the progessive form of the disease
however when challenged with large dose of the virus these mink did develop progressive aleutian disease indicating that they were not highly resistant to the virus
the anti adv antibody activity in mink with inapparent type of adv infection was in the igg fraction of the serum the same as in mink with progressive aleutian disease
these data indicate that the resistance of the mink with inapparent infection as compared to mink with progressive aleutian disease was not due to difference in the class of immunoglobulin response to the virus
however mink with progressive aleutian disease showed greatly increased immunoglobulin response

possible biochemical basis of memory disorder in alzheimer disease
possible biochemical basis of memory disorder in alzheimer disease
the most common presenting symptom of alzheimer disease is loss of short term memory and histologically the hippocampus is affected
choline which is involved in the synthesis of acetylcholine is depleted in the hippocampus in the disorder
anticholinergic drugs administered to normal subjects can simulate some aspects of the memory defect seen in alzheimer disease
it is postulated that damage to cholinergic neuronal pathway running to or from the hippocampus underlies the memory disorder
this suggestion implies that it may be possible to improve memory in patients with alzheimer disease by pharmacological means

impaired very low density lipoprotein and triglyceride removal in broad beta disease comparison with endogenous
the removal rate of apoprotein apo in very low density lipoprotein vldl was decreased in individuals with broad beta disease when compared with endogenous
following the injection of vldl isolated from individuals with endogenous both vldl apo fractional catabolic rate hr and vldl apo turnover rate mg kg hr were lower in broad beta disease than in endogenous fractional catabolic rate less than turnover rate less than despite equivalent plasma concentrations of vldl apo furthermore conversion of vldl apo to ldl was impaired in broad beta disease relative to endogenous
following the injection of vldl isolated from individuals with endogenous both vldl apo fractional catabolic rate hr and vldl apo turnover rate mg kg hr were lower in broad beta disease than in endogenous fractional catabolic rate less than turnover rate less than despite equivalent plasma concentrations of vldl apo furthermore conversion of vldl apo to ldl was impaired in broad beta disease relative to endogenous
these differences suggest an abnormality in the interaction of lipoprotein lipase with the lipoproteins of unusual composition in broad beta disease
this is further supported by the normalization of lipoprotein composition in broad beta disease by estrogen therapy with simultaneous change in the kinetics of lipoprotein lipase related triglyceride removal towards those seen in endogenous

the assess whether the magnitude of exercise induced st segment depression improves the predictive values of symptom limited exercise tests and helps in the recognition of patients with more severe coronary heart disease consecutive patients with positive treadmill tests who also underwent selective coronary arteriography were reviewed
the incidence of and vessel disease increased from with st depression greater than or equal to mm in the overall population to with st depression greater than or equal to mm in the select group and the incidence of left main trunk lesions increased respectively from to
the prediction of and vessels disease was found to be significantly greater when patients were dichotomized into those with st depression greater than or equal to mm compared to less than mm
it is concluded that the magnitude of st segment depression definitely improves the predictive values of exercise tests as well as the ability to recognize the patients with more severe disease
however the markedly positive exercise tests cannot be utilized to accurately predict the presence of or vessel disease in individual cases unless st depression attains mm or more in patients with normal baseline who are not taking digitalis

sequential changes of surfactant in hyaline membrane disease of the newborn
although reduced levels of lung surfactant are known to predispose to hyaline membrane disease the role of biochemical changes in surfactant composition has not been defined
we found that surfactant isolated from pharyngeal and tracheal aspirates of newborns with hyaline membrane disease had distinctly different fatty acid composition from surfactant of control infants
surfactant from newborns with hyaline membrane disease had lower percentage of palmitic acid and higher percentages of the carbon and carbon fatty acids irrespective of gestational age
evaluation of serial aspirates for days revealed that in hyaline membrane disease the surfactant fatty acids followed predictable pattern of change gradually becoming similar to those of the control group
evaluation of surfactant from tracheal and pharyngeal aspirates effectively monitors the biochemical maturation of the surfactant system in hyaline membrane disease

relationships among immunoglobulin markers in graves disease
thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin tsi activity was measured by radioreceptor assay in sera from patients with graves disease hashimoto thyroiditis and thyroid cancer
in untreated graves disease cases tsi index was significantly lower se than the average of normal control group cases
after treatment the tsi index in graves disease decreased during months then increased and reached normal levels in yr
there was no significant relationship between tsi index and thyroid antibodies microsomal antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies in untreated graves disease or hashimoto thyroiditis
it is concluded that in the sera of patients with graves disease and hashimoto thyroiditis there are immunoglobulin gs that can displace tsh binding to thyroid membranes these immunoglobulins
gs are different from the classic antithyroid antibodies and treatment of graves disease may enhance tsi production during the first months after therapy

the mean tbab index for patients with ophthalmopathy and past or present hyperthyroidism was significantly less than for those patients with eye disease but no associated hyperthyroidism euthyroid graves disease
tbab levels did not correlate with the severity of duration of the eye disease and did not change during treatment with cy
significant titres of serum antibodies against human eye muscle extract or subcellular fractions or macrophage inhibitory factor mif production in response to human orbital tissue extract were not detected in patients with eye disease
tbab are unlikely to play role in the pathogenesis of graves ophthalmopathy and the hyperthyroidism and eye disease should be considered separate autoimmune disorders
the apparently anomalous finding of higher mean tbab index in patients with eye disease and hyperthyroidism than in those with hyperthyroidiam alone may reflect more severe defect of suppressor cell function in the former group

no patient without graves disease developed late hypocalcemia
the incidence of hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy for graves disease was significantly greater than that seen in other conditions
since no parathyroids were removed in the patients with graves disease and since branches of the inferior thyroid artery were invariably ligated distal to the parathyroids we hypothesized that the late hypocalcemia might be associated with peculiarity in scar formation in the presence of this autoimmune disease
since no parathyroids were removed in the patients with graves disease and since branches of the inferior thyroid artery were invariably ligated distal to the parathyroids we hypothesized that the late hypocalcemia might be associated with peculiarity in scar formation in the presence of this autoimmune disease
accordingly parathyroid was performed synchronously as prophylactic measure in nine subsequent patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for graves disease no instance of late hypocalcemia has occurred in this group
although the precise etiology of late hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy for graves disease remains undetermined this experience indicates that synchronous parathyroid is beneficial in preventing this complication

four hundred and forty five neck dissections for epidermoid carcinoma over year period are reviewed as to local recurrence of neck disease
evaluation of this series of cases indicate that the control of local disease in the neck in the and groups is is accomplished as well with conservative dissection as with radical neck dissection
the number of conservative neck dissections for disease was too limited for accurate comparison
there were no conservative neck dissections done for disease
we suggest that conservative neck dissection be utilized for subclinical and disease and that the classic en bloc dissection be reserved for and situations

changes are observed in the renal kallikrein kinin system in hypertensive disease which are displayed by compensatory increase in its activity in patients with labile hypertension and decrease in the activity of this system in patients with stable stage of the disease
changes are observed in the renal kallikrein kinin system in hypertensive disease which are displayed by compensatory increase in its activity in patients with labile hypertension and decrease in the activity of this system in patients with stable stage of the disease
the kallikrein kinin system is concerned with the noted shifts in renal function linked with the transport of sodium and water in patients with the labile stage of the disease to which the correlative connection between kallikrein excretion and natriuresis and urine excretion attests
it is suggested that the renal kallikrein kinin system in patients with the initial stage of hypertensive disease contributes to the adaptation of renal function to the altered conditions of hemodynamics and the increased activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system
the indices of central hemodynamics were studied during hemiton therapy in patients with stage iia and iib hypertensive disease by means of noninvasive method tetrapolar chest rheography
changes in the coagulation properties of blood under the effect of physical exertion on bicycle ergometer were studied in patients with hypertensive disease

three abnormalities of eye movement in man are described which are indicative of cerebellar system disorder namely centripetally beating nystagmus failure to maintain lateral gaze either in darkness or with eye closure and slow drifting movements of the eyes in the absence of fixation
these abnormalities of eye movement together with other signs of cerebellar disease such as rebound alternating and gaze paretic nystagmus are explained by the hypothesis that the cerebellum helps to maintain lateral gaze and that brain stem mechanisms which monitor gaze position generate compensatory biases in the absence of normal cerebellar function

bile acid studies in uncomplicated crohn disease
the pool size and composition of bile acids were studied in unoperated patients with uncomplicated crohn disease patients with ulcerative colitis and normal subjects
many patients with crohn disease had in their bile significantly increased amount of ursodeoxycholic acid
the bile acid pool size was significantly decreased and the ratio of glycine to taurine conjugates was significantly increased in the crohn disease patients
the reduction in bile acid pool size was related to the activity of the disease
the disorders of bile acid metabolism suggest that the intestinal involvement in crohn disease is much more extensive than can be demonstrated by careful radiological examinations
glycocholate test in crohn disease its value in assessment and treatment
the glycocholic acid test gca has been assessed in patients who have had resection of the ileum and colon for crohn disease and in patients with unoperated stable crohn disease
