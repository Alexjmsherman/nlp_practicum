    "In this homework, we will use python-docx to extract and structure the text from a Microsoft Word document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall objective (part 3) is to structure the document into sections. As there is no perfect method to define or identify document sections, we will create our own simple hueristics. These include looking if a paragraph contains 'HEADING' styles, uses ALL CAPS, or applies other styles like bold or underlined text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part one and two, we will create and test two helper functions (doesnt_have_text and is_section_header) to help us identify which paragraphs contain useful text and/or are section headers in part 3."
